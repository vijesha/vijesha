<p><b>Tiptur was historically a part of Honnavalli, a village headquarters located 11 miles northwest of Tiptur in Tumkur district. Honnavalli was the taluk headquarters until 1886[citation needed]. The history of the village dates back to eleventh century[citation needed]. It was built by the king Someswara Raaya, who belonged to the Harnahalli Nayak dynasty[citation needed]. Legend has it that Honnu Amma, the family deity of the Paalegaar, appeared in a dream and directed him to build a model village in her name. Even today 'Honnavalli Amma' is the village goddess.[2]
